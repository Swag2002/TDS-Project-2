Explanation of the Code:
Libraries Installation:

Install openai for using the GPT model and pandas for handling datasets.
Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Load Dataset:

The pd.read_csv(url) command loads the dataset from a CSV file (you can replace this with your dataset URL or file path).
We use dataset.head() to preview the data.
Preprocessing:

Here, missing data is dropped using dropna(). You can add more preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, etc., depending on your dataset.
LLM-Based Analysis:

The analyze_text_with_llm function sends a prompt to the GPT model and returns its response. You can adjust the prompt to perform various tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, or text classification.
In this example, it analyzes the text column in the dataset and stores the result in a new column.
Visualization:

If the analysis generates categorical results (e.g., sentiments), you can use seaborn and matplotlib to create charts or plots.
